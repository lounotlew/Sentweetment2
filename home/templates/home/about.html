  	<p class="card-text">
  		<p style="text-align: left;">Sentweetment 2 is a Django web application for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter accounts (users). Using the <a href="https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment" target="_blank">VADER Lexicon</a>, Sentweetment 2 tokenizes each tweet made by a user (for a max. of latest 200 tweets, limited by the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html" target="_blank">Twitter API</a>) to individual words, and applies a polarity score to each word. Then, these individual scores are aggregated per-tweet to give an overall tweet polarity score. These scores are also used to calculate an overall user polarity score (by their average), and ultimately the general sentiment of a Twitter account/user. All of these operations are performed through <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas.</a></p>
  		<p><i>What is a "Polarity Score"?</i></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">A polarity score is a number that tells us how "positive" or "negative" a word is, <i>in the context of social media.</i> These scores are determined by the <a href="https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment" target="_blank">lexicon</a> mentioned above. A tweet's polarity score is the sum of that tweet's individual words' polarities, and a user's sentiment score is the average polarity of all the tweets that were analyzed (max. of latest 200 tweets).</p>
      <p><i>Notes</i></p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">- The methodology is based on <a href="https://github.com/DS-100/sp18/blob/master/proj/proj1/proj1.ipynb" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's Data Science 100 Project 1: "Trump, Twitter, and Text".</a></p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">- Although the overall context of a tweet isn't taken into account (yet), the general idea is that the more positive/negative words a tweet contains, the more likely it is that that tweet is positive/negative.</p>
