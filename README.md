> Written by Lewis Kim

### Description

PH Description.


This web application is mostly based on an earlier project I did, [Sentweetment](https://github.com/lounotlew/Sentweetment), and is essentially a port from a ``tkinter`` interface to a Django web interface.

### Installation

RJL was written in Python 3.6, and may not work with Python 2.

Required packages:
- ``Django``: (``pip3 install django``)

To view this website, PH.
